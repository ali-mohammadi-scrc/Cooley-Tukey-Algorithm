# Mixed-Radix Cooley-Tukey

This is an implementation of [Mixed-Radix Cooley-Tukey FFT Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm) in Matlab. 
Additionally, we used it to implement autocorrelation function using [Wienerâ€“Khinchin Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%E2%80%93Khinchin_theorem).

# Using Instruction

Download scripts and put it in your project directory or put anywhere you want and add its path in your Matlab. 
For a numeric series x, run either of following commands.

	Output = FFT(x)
	Output = InverseFFT(x) 
	Output = AutoCorr(x)
